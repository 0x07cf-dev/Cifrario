## Whoever you are, please don't bother
This is an unfinished project I had to submit for my first year course of computer architectures. 
What was supposed to be a 2-student task turned out to be one young man's nightmare.
My partner quit university before the end of it. It was my first time with assembly.
No wonder it doesn't even work properly.

It's just a memory.
